	<hr color="black">
	<p>First of all i will tell you the use of HTML in our life.<br><br>It is used to make adorable websites which enhance your skills in CS and you can leran it very easily because it's the most easiest language among all the languages of computer.<br><br><b>HTML is a case sensitive language means it does not care either you use capital or small letters in same line or in same page.</b><br>So let's begin with it's basics....</p>
	<br>
	<p>Now we are going to begin with some tags used in it.(I hope so you know about it's boiller palette which is it's basic coding.)</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p id="baap">Note:- All the important text will be bold.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>First tag is image tag and it's command is ("img src")</p>
	<br>
  Explaination:- <b>img src="type here the path of your image in quotes(double/single)" and after name of image use a dot and type the extension like .jpg/.png etc.(I am not using these symbols (< >) because these will not display my text message to you but you wil have to use because it's must.)</b>
  <p>Now moving onto next tag which is ("hr")</p>
  <br>
  Explaination:- <b>By using this tag you can draw horizontals line as i have drawn on the top and bottom side of my heading HTML.</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>By default it's colour is black but you can also change it using command in hr tag (hr color="colour of your choice").<br>Note the spelling of colour in command.<br>You would be thinking i wrote wrong but while coding in html we have to use this spelling of colour otherwise it will not work.</b>
  <p>Our next tag is ("I")</p>
  <br>
  Explaination:- <b>If you wanna make your text writing good then you can use this tag for making your writing italic.</b>
  <p>Now  moving onto next tag whih is ("B")</p>
  <br>
  Explaination:- <b>For making your text bold.</b>
  <p>Next tag is ("br")</p>
  <br>
  Explaination:- </b>It's used to break the lines or can say for starting new line from next line not in the same line.</b>
  <p>Now i will tell you the difference b/w empty tags and container tags</p>
  <br>
  Empty Tags:- <b>These tags require opening as well as closing</b> eg. body,p,html,head,title etc.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Container Tags:- <b>These tags do not require closing</b> eg. I,br,hr,b etc.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  So, this was the basic of HTML.I hope you got all my points but even if you have doubt then you call me personally on my number which i have given to you.
